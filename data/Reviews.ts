        review: "This was the first time we had hauled out our FP47 Cat, Ben and Jenny made the process easy. The use of the morning ball made it easy to stage the boat prior to early morning haul out. We were able to get all our tasks done on time. It is obvious that Ben and Jenny care about the boats and people in the boat year. Ben went above and beyond to help us learn some new skills that we will put to use in future haul outs.",

        review: "I needed to rent a mooring ball while in the Cairns area for about a month.  The cost of marina berths being very prohibitive up here.   A friend referred me to Cairns Boat Yard and suggested I talk to the owner Ben who was very helpful in this regard.  Ben has mooring balls for rent at very reasonable prices.  Ben was also very helpful offering advice and knowledge on a variety of subjects and I'm grateful for his taking the time to share his experience with me.  I felt very reassured that my boat was in good hands while moored within sight of the boatyard and Ben's watchful eye and would recommend anyone needing boatyard services, haulouts, or a mooring ball to contact Ben.  Will definitely be back again!  Highly recommended!",

        review: "We had a five star experience here thanks to the attentiveness of the owners and staff who are around to oversee the haul out and beyond. The yard is friendly, clean, great value for money and we were able to stay onboard while on the hard and do all our own work if we wished. Ben, the owner and his wife, are extremely helpful and supportive, offering lots of tips and advice when we sought it. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this yard, in fact in six years it was our best experience yet and I do not recommend boatyards easily!! Thanks guys, if we do another loop we will be back in a flash!",

        review: "Highly professional, well resourced, extremely helpful with a wealth of knowledge of anything in  maritime technology. With many years experience as renowned boat builders, the proprietors have developed this facility to safely move boats out and back into of the water with absolute compliance to the EPA and Maritime safety.  Any advice provided is done so with the ethos of perfection. I highly recommend Ben and his Crew as Super friendly, highly professional engineers who will not do a job other than well.

        review: "Hauled out by Cairns boat yard in December 2022, we were unable to make it up to cairns for haul out, Ben went and grabbed our boat off the mooring with no worries,  Ben & Jennys communication and can do attitude was unreal, once we arrived We felt very welcome, with only a 5 minute dinghy ride from town, surrounded by a wealth of knowledge. Honest and reliable service and we wouldn‚Äôt haul out anywhere else. Thanks Ben and Jenny Merry Christmas from Cori & Angus Cool Runnings üòéüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è",

He was a pleasure to deal with from start to finish and made it incredibly easy to facilitate the work from the other side of the country. I would highly recommend this service. - Cameron Birch.

        review: "Ben hauled out our lagoon 440 for her cleaning & anti fouling last week. Great to have this facility in cairns as opposed to the larger commercial yards that are over priced as I have been hauled out there before & your boat comes out really dirty on the upper deck due to all of the other commercial boats working around you & vehicles driving in & out on the dirt creating a mess. I was really impressed with how little mess was on the decküëå. It‚Äôs only a half hour drive from cairns & the road is really good so that wasn‚Äôt an issue. Ben was very helpful & knowledgeable in his running of the yard. all round great bloke. Thank you heaps. we will be back in a couple of years for our next lift. Cannot recommended highly enough with way this operation is run. - Dave & Nic, Sv Nauti-blu, Lagoon 440",

        review: "Ben and Jenny pulled our 45ft Leopard catamaran out on the 3rd of August 2020 for her anti foul slipping. I can not speak more highly of the professional and genuine helpful service received at Cairns Boat Yard. We travel to Cairns frequently and although we have enquired about slipping in Cairns prior, up untill now, it has always proven far more cost effective to slip back down at Coomera. However now with Cairns Boat Yard it has proven definitely finacial superior and far friendlier than any where else we have found on the East Coast to slip your boat.",
